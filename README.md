<h1> Together </h1>
Together is a game about playing games, growing up, and making friends. <p>
The player takes on the role of Sam, the heart of an online friend group, and engages in exploration and battle for glory, acheivement, and team bonding. Battles are RPG-style and the theming of the art and music in each battle and overworld reflects which game the group is currently playing. <p>
Over the course of six years in the world of the game, we watch our characters grow and learn about themselves and each other. The player is invited to reflect upon fond memories of their own, in an era when friendships can be made anywhere, even in the streets of an online videogame.
